**BLACK JACK**  

**GOAL**  
The sum of your cards should be greater than the sum of the dealers cards.
Also sum of the cards cannot go above 21 and if the sum is 21 it is called Blackjack.
Blackjack always wins.  

**DESCRIPTION**  
BlackJack is a famous casino game , and this is a simplified version of the real game(which involves bidding and various other stuff).
All players play againt the dealer of the cards.
All the cards have fixed values associated to them and the main objective of the game is
to get the score as high as possible but less than or equal to 21.
It is a fun short game.  

**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
First I decided the Game Design:
It had to be played on the terminal
I wrote a function to print out a card to the terminal.

Then I went into the logic part:
I defined a class of cards and formed a Deck as the array of cards.
Then I wrote the main Game Logic:
Cards are given using random function,
Player can choose to Hit or Stand,
Players and dealers cards and values are shown on the screen.
