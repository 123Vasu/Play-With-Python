**Pomodoro Timer App**  

**GOAL**  
The Goal of this game is to create a Pomodoro Timer App. 

**DESCRIPTION**  
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals. Each work interval is called a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato (plural: pomodori). That is the reason of the Tomato Theme of this app.

### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Tkinter: It is a inbuilt python library which provides useful GUI functionalities.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
Used Tkinter GUI library to make UI for the App, and created logic to simulate a Pomodoro timer. Set the Work time and start the timer. The timer automatically enters break mode after timer ends. Declared reps to denote the repetitions for short breaks and long breaks.
