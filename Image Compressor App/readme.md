# Image Compressor App

**Approach**
- import `tkinter` and   `PIL` modules
- use `filedialog.askopenfilename()` to select image file
- use `Image.open()` to open the image
- use `save()` by passing `quality` parameter to compress the image and save the compressed image

**Demonstration**

- Create a folder named Image Compressor 
- save the python source code file in that folder
- run the program and select the image
- compressed image will be saved in the same folder that you created
