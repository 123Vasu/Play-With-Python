IMAGE GRAYSCALLING

GOAL
This is a simple image editor created in python programming language using tkinter.

DESCRIPTION
The goal is to convert colorful image provided by user to grayscale

To run this application download image_grayscale.py and resources in the same directory.

Open and run the file image_grayscale.py
A black window will appear.
Another window will open up in which the application will be running.
Click on Upload Image.
A Dialog box will appear to select image from files, upload a image.
Small Preview of grayscaled image is displayed.
Click on Download button to save the original Size image.:-D
For restart, you don't need to close the window, just upload another picture.

WHAT I HAD DONE
In this game, I implemented Two function that take image and provide option to download grayscaled image along with preview.
The Main thing is, you don't need to download or install any library or modules.
All things are packed in one application, so you need to just run that.

DEMONSTRATION


I wish this application will be useful to you :-D
