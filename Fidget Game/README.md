**FIDGET GAME**  

**GOAL**  
The Goal of this game is to simulate a Fidget Spinner, based on Google Theme. 

**DESCRIPTION**  
A fidget spinner is a toy that consists of a ball bearing in the center of a multi-lobed (typically two or three) flat structure made from metal or plastic designed to spin along its axis with pressure. Fidget spinner become popular among kids and adults, as a satisfying toy.
Controls : It has the following controls:
1) Left and Right arrows to rotate the Spinner in direction.
2) The longer you hold down the arrow key, the higher its speed.

### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. PyGame: Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games. Make sure to install PyGame library before playing the game.
2. Sys: The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment.
3. Math: Provides useful math function for simplifying equations and calculations.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
1) Import Libraries - pygame and initialize it. 
2) Created Necessary Variables like background color, line width, etc. Also generated screen.
3) Created show_spinner, which contains rotation logic, using trig methods from math package to determine positions of arms based on angle provided. 
4) Drawn various Shapes for printing Fidget Spinner on screen, using pygame.draw
5) Created a main loop to integrate all functions together, declared important parameters such as speed, friction. Defined controls to change direction of spinner and regulated respective parameters to make sure spinner work as prescibed.
