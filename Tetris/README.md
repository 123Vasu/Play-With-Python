**TETRIS GAME**  

**GOAL**  
The Goal is to Create a Tetris Game.

**DESCRIPTION**  
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game which has a simple goal of destroying lines of blocks before it reaches the top. The line is made up of a square block. The Tetrimino is the shape of the 4 connected blocks that fall down. The player will have to use the Tetrominos to create lines that fill the box. This will clear the lines of blocks. The game continues, the lines of blocks that is not completely filled will drop down as many lines that were cleared. The game has levels of difficulties which rises as the game is being played.

**BASIC CONTROLS** 
1) Press Left arrow key(←) and right arrow key(→) to move the block within the grid.
2) Press up arrow key(↑) to rotate the falling piece.
3) Press down arrow key(↓) to increase falling speed.

### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. PyGame: Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games. Make sure to install PyGame library before playing the game.
2. Random: Random is a inbuilt python library to generate random blocks in this game.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
1) Import Libraries - pygame and initialize it. 
2) Declared necessary variables and defined all basic block shapes and their rotations, in a list.
3) Declared necessary functions such as create_grid() for grid creation, valid_space() to check for empty space, etc.
4) Created main() function, that has all the game logic written to it. Declared falling speed, all key commands, rotation logic and finally place block on grid, after it reached the surface.
5) Declared a _main()_ function, containing main loop and declared screen, and wrote update logic.
