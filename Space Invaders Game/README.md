**SPACE INVADERS GAME**  

**GOAL**  
This is a classic space invader game created in python programming language using pygame.


**DESCRIPTION**  
Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed to the Midway division of Bally for overseas distribution. Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.

To play this game download space invader.py and resources in the same directory. 

You also need to have pygame installed in your computer. Learn how to install pygame from [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation)

Open and run the file space invader.py without making any modifications to it to ensure that everything is set up correctly. By "open and run" I mean do the following:
* Go to your IDE. From the File menu, choose "Open".
* Find the file space invader.py and choose it.
* The template space invader.py file should now be open. Run the file and enjoy the game :-D

You can play the game using up, left, right and down arrow keys to move the snake. Aim for apple and get highest score as possible :-D


**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
In this game, I implemented two classes known as laser and ship and two child classes of ship i.e, enemy and player o that will start up and carry out an interactive Space Invaders game. The game uses a resources folder for graphics of background, lasers and ships
