**SNAKE GAME**  

**GOAL**  
This is pong game created in python programming language using pygame.


**DESCRIPTION**  
Pong is one of the first computer games that was ever created, this simple "tennis-like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain 10 points, and a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.

The game can be played with two human players
Left Player can use W, S keys to move the paddle
While Right player can use up arrow, down arrow keys to move the paddle

To play this game download pong.py..

You also need to have pygame installed in your computer. Learn how to install pygame from [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation)

Open and run the file pong.py without making any modifications to it to ensure that everything is set up correctly. By "open and run" I mean do the following:
* Go to your IDE. From the File menu, choose "Open".
* Find the file pong.py and choose it.
* The template pong.py file should now be open. Run the file and enjoy the game :-D



**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
In this game, I implemented two classes for paddle and ball and also functions like handle_collision and handle_paddle_movement that will start up and carry out an interactive pong game.
