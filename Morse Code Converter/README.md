**MORSE**  

**GOAL**  
This is a morse code convertor created using OOP concepts and tkinter library 


**DESCRIPTION**  
Sorse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. Read more about morse code from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)


To run this save all the JSON files and morse.py and main.py in same directory.


Open and run the file space main.py without making any modifications to it to ensure that everything is set up correctly. By "open and run" I mean do the following:
* Go to your IDE. From the File menu, choose "Open".
* Find the file main.py and choose it.
* The template space main.py file should now be open. Run the file and enjoy morse code convertor :-D



**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
In this project with the help of JSON files, I created two files the morse.py and other main.py

Morse code algorithm is created using class and function in morse.py and main.py imports morse.py for further GUI creation
