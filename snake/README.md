**SNAKE GAME**  

**GOAL**  
This is a classic snake game created in python programming language using pygame.


**DESCRIPTION**  
Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a line that grows bigger after eating something, typically apples. Know about snake game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))



To play this game download snake.py and resources in the same directory. 

You also need to have pyjama installed in your computer. Learn how to install pygame from [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation)

Open and run the file snake.py without making any modifications to it to ensure that everything is set up correctly. By "open and run" I mean do the following:
* Go to your IDE. From the File menu, choose "Open".
* Find the file snake.py and choose it.
* The template snake.py file should now be open. Run the file and enjoy the game :-D

You can play the game using up, left, right and down arrow keys to move the snake. Aim for apple and get highest score as possible :-D


**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
In this game, I implemented three classes known as apples, snake and game, that will start up and carry out an interactive Snake game. The game uses a resources folder for graphics of apple, snake and game window as well as background music and other game sounds.
