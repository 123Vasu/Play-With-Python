**Minesweeper**

**GOAL**

The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a grid that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath. The location of most mines is discovered through a logical process, but some require guessing, usually with a 50-50 chance of being correct.


**DESCRIPTION**

The player is first presented with a grid containing a number of indistinguishable squares containing
a number of pre-specified mines.
To play the game, the player has to click on a square in the grid. The square maybe:
1. **Blank:** has no mine adjacent to it
2. **Containing a number:** Hints at the number of mines adjacent to it
3. **Containing a mine:** If the player clicks on this, the game is over.
The player can place flags on squares in which he thinks
To win the game, the player has to correctly “flag” the positions of all the mines on the board.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1) Pygame
2) Sys
3) Random
