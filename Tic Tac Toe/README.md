**TIC TAC TOE**  

**GOAL**  
The Goal of this game is to create a Tic Tac Toe game. 

**DESCRIPTION**  
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. First Player to get 3 consecutive squares, diagonally or horizontally wins the game. A game in which two players take turns placing circles and crosses on a 3x3 grid and attempt to obtain three of the same symbols in a straight line.

### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. PyGame: Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games. Make sure to install PyGame library before playing the game.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
1) Import Libraries - pygame and initialize it. 
2) Define the layout of the Tic Tac Toe Board, by drawing four lines with draw_lines() function, and providing necessary arguments such as Screen fill, etc. 
3) Generate basic logic, using a 3x3 list, and updating it everytime player clicks on it. Draw figures using draw_figures() function.
4) Check the winning condition, by iterating over all rows and columns, and two diagonals. Create a Winning line if winning condition is satisfied. 
5) Print on screen, if any of the two players won, or is it a tie, if no empty spaces remain.
