**DESCRIPTION**  
Slot Machine is a popular gambling machine. In this, you gamble money on 'Lines'. Lines are horizontal rows with same character. If you win Lines, you gain money, otherwise you lose. Each vertical reel consist of some symbols, and each reel is independent from others.

### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
1) Import Libraries - random, for slot machine interface.
2) Ask the user for deposit. This is total money user will bet from.
3) Ask user on how many lines will he bet on and what amount does he bet on each line. More the lines, more the gain if he wins, otherwise more loss. 
4) Get number of lines from "get_number_of_lines()" and "pass it to get_slot_machine_spin()" to create a random grid of symbols.
5) Check user winnings using "check_winnings()" and update user balance. 
6) Repeat till user balance is zero and then call "deposit()" to update balance and continue game.
