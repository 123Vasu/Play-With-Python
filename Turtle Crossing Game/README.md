**Turtle Crossing Game**  

**GOAL**  
The Goal of this game is to create a Turtle Crossing Game. 

**DESCRIPTION**  
In this game, turtle has to cross the road, with running cars safely. If road crossed safely, turtle moves to next level, with even faster cars.

### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Turtle: provides a powerful graphic tool.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**  
1) Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the "Up" keypress to move the turtle north.
2) Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. 
3) Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens.
4) Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached the FINISH_LINE_Y). When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars.
5) Create a scoreboard that keeps track of which level the user is on. Every time the turtle player does a successful crossing, the level should increase. When the turtle hits a car, GAME OVER should be displayed in the centre.
